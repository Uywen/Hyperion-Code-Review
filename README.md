# Section A Option 4 : Cypher

Used Javascript to create a cypher where  user can enter any word and it would be encrypted.
I made the shift to 13 and subtracted 26 each time the letter would go over the last letter
of the alphabet so that it could start at the letter A again.

The mess variable will contain the string that the user enters thats why it is 
contains a prompt so that the user can enter their desired word to be translated.

Added my Javascript to the html file called cypher.html where the user will be greeted
with a prompt asking the user what word they would like to encrypt.The answer to the
users request will be displayed in the console of the browsers which can be accessed
using ctrl + i and the developer tools will appear then click on the console ribbon
and the answer will appear.

The user needs to use node js to debug in the console.
Using a code editor of their choice.

# Section C Option 1 : Say the Number
Created this function usng Javascript and node js

Created a function that turns any number entered by the user into 
words.However if the user enters a number longer than 15 digits 
it will not be able to translate the number into words.

To view the number entered by the user in words you need
to have node js installed in your code editor on your local
machine.Because the answers will be displayed in the console
of the terminal

Any number the user enters in the console.log will display in
the console.
