#Section A Option 4

Used Javascript to create a cypher where  user can enter any word and it would be encrypted.
I made the shift to 13 and subtracted 26 each time the letter would go over the last letter
of the alphabet so that it could start at the letter A again.

Added my Javascript to the html file called cypher.html where the user will be greeted
with a prompt asking the user what word they would like to encrypt.The answer to the
users request will be displayed in the console of the browsers which can be accessed
using ctrl + i and the developer tools will appear then click on the console ribbon
and the answer will appear
